# ML_orbit_infall_project

This is a project with Dr. Diemer that will use data from the IllustrisTNG 300 dark matter simulation. The goal is to construct a machine learning model that can predict if a particle is either currently orbiting a dark matter halo or is infalling into one.

This repository will contain files to adjust the data outputted by SPARTA into two training arrays of radius and velocities of particles. These arrays will then be used to train and test a machine learning model.
